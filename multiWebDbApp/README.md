  - Contains database storage component (data stored in Redis)
- A Redis DB

- A ConfigMaps to contain certain configuration data for the Golang and Python applications

# Information on kubernetes volumes

Kubernetes volumes worked quite different from normal dockerfiles.

- In a deployment pod
  - Specify the volumes via the usage of persistant volume claims
- Specify a persistent volume claim
- Specify a persistent volume

Locally, it has to be manually done for now, no dynamic provisioning of storage is available locally

```bash
kubectl apply -f pv.yaml
kubectl apply -f mysql.yaml
```

Note during mounting, each application is required to have the data to be loaded on the appropriate folder. Do check each application to view where the folder has to be loaded up
