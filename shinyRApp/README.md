# Sample Shiny application

This is a sample shiny application deployed on docker. In the case where we would want to deploy a R dashboard application that a member from the data science intends to have. Currently, added a sample R shiny application that would be added to the right directory which would then be hosted by the shiny server.

**Note**: R Shiny servers require websockets; research is needed in order to find if its possible to have it rely on some fallback to http protocol instead of relying on websockets.
